Quick tips: 

** if you are using GIT for Desktop (windows) you simply need to select wich repository do you wanna use and then 
open prefered text editor using keys CTRL + SHIFT + A 

If VS Code is your prefered text editor then all repository will be available instant,
If you made changes to any file just save the changes and go to Source control on the left side and 
type in a message then CTRL + ENTER

now you have to go to GIT For windows and there it will ask you to push the content to git web CRTL + P

once that is done, a copy of your work will be saved online.
